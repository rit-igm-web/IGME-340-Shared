# Dart ICE 2 - Lists

In Dartpad, create a **New Pad** and replace everything in the editor with the following code:
```dart
void main() {
    
}
```
## Perform the following tasks: ##
1. Create a new `fixed size` array called `myList1` with five 0's inside, hint, use `var` for the data type. Then change **index 2** to `1`, and print it.

2. Create a loosely typed `growable` list called `myList2`. Add one of every data type into the list (String, int, double, boolean), and print it.

3. Insert `IGME` into myList2 at **index 2** (the third position), and print it.

4. Create a new list called `myList3` that contains `['item1', 'item2', 'item3']`, then add **all individual elements** from myList3 into myList2 and print it.

5. Create a new list called `myList4` that contains `[123.4, 'item 6', false]` and insert **all individual elements** at the very beginning of myList2 and print it.

6. Create a new `growable String` array called `myList5` (hint: use type specification), and add a few string items to it and print it.

7. Remove the item at **index 2** (3rd position) from `myList5`, and print the result.

8. Remove the **last** item from `myList5`, and print the result.

9. Remove items at **indices 1 through 3** (positions 2-4) in `myList2`, and print the result.

Save the resulting file as `dart_ice_02.dart` for submission.
